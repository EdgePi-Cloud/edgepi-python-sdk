"""Utility module for computing ADC conversion delay time"""

# ADC conversion delay time is affected by the following factors:
# - Conversion delay (REG_MODE0) -> currently not user-configurable
# - Digital filter mode (REG_MODE1)
# - Data rate mode (REG_MODE2)
# - IDAC/Chop mode (REG_MODE0) -> currently not user-configurable
