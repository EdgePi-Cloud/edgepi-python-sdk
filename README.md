# How to Use EdgePi SDK
## How to Install
The latest stable release of the EdgePi SDK will be available to be installed via The Python Package Index (PyPi). To install the EdgePi SDK from PyPi via pip, you may use the following command from terminal:

```
$ python3 -m pip install edgepi-python-sdk
```
## Example Code
The EdgePi SDK provides a wide range of functionality to users, allowing interaction with the many modules onboard the EdgePi. One such module, the ADC, can be used to read voltage continuously from any of the eight EdgePi analog input pins:

```
from edgepi.adc.edgepi_adc import EdgePiADC
from edgepi.adc.adc_constants import ADCChannel, ConvMode, ADCNum

# initialize ADC
edgepi_adc = EdgePiADC()

# configure ADC to sample analog input pin AIN3
edgepi_adc.set_config(adc_1_analog_in=ADCChannel.AIN3, conversion_mode=ConvMode.CONTINUOUS)

# send command to start continuous conversions
edgepi_adc.start_conversions(ADCNum.ADC_1)

# perform 10 voltage reads
for _ in range(10):
  out = edgepi_adc.read_voltage(ADCNum.ADC_1)
  print(out)
  
# stop continuous conversions
edgepi_adc.stop_conversions(ADCNum.ADC_1)
```
For further details on this and other modules, please refer to each module's documentation by following the links provided in the `Implemented Modules` section below.

# Development
Active development SDK versions can be accessed from the following resources:
## Installing from TestPyPi
To install the most recent active development SDK version via [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/edgepi-python-sdk/):
```

$ python3 -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/edgepi-python-sdk
```
Previous development SDK versions can also be installed by specifiying the version number:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/edgepi-python-sdk==<version-number>
```
Please refer to [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/edgepi-python-sdk/) for available SDK versions.

## Installing from GitHub
To install the SDK via HTTPS from GitHub:
```
$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/EdgePi-Cloud/edgepi-python-sdk.git@<branch-name>
```

# Packaging
To build and publish a new SDK version as a package, a build virtual environment is required. This may be configured as follows:
```
$ cd edgepi-python-sdk

$ python3 -m venv venv_build

$ source venv_build/bin/activate 

$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements_build.txt
```
With the build environment configured and activated, a new distribution can be built as follows:
```
$ python3 -m build
```
Note, when the package structure changes, such as after renaming the `src` module or other folders, delete the `.egg-info` file from `/src` and rebuild. This will ensure the file names in the compiled package are updated. Also note that changes in file/folder name capitalization are recognized by git. To disable this:
```
git config --global core.ignorecase false
```

With the new disbtribution created, you may publish to the official Python package repositories:

To publish to TestPyPi:
```
$ python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose
```
To publish to PyPi:
```
$ python3 -m twine upload dist/* --verbose
```

Both TestPyPi and PyPi will prompt you for authentication. For best practices, use a corresponding TestPyPi or PyPi token to authenticate as follows:
```
name: __token__
password: <token-value>
```
Make sure to include the `pypi-` prefix for your token value.
